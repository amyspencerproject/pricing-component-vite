## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) - React framework

### What I learned

- Made a checkbox toggle with a horizontal slider with CSS! Tried to make this as accessbile as possible, even used `will-change: transform;` on the toggle handle.
- Using Vite! Trying to give up using Create React App and Vite so far has a shallow learning curve ðŸ¥³.
- Could not use the HTML entity `&dollar;` with Vite. I had to switch to `&#36;` which is ASCII. Other HTML entities worked just fine like `&amp`; and `&times;`. I could not find a clear answer as to why.

### Continued development
